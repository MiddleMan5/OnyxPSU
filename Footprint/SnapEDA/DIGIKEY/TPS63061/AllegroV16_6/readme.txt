To import your new library parts into Allegro:

1. Using your Windows explorer, find the file that was included
in your zip file that ends in ".bat".  This is a batch file
set of instructions for your computer.  Double clicking this
file should start the batch file.  You must already have Allegro
installed and runnning on the computer that the batch file was
created on, or you will need to modify the pathing of the
batch file.

2. It will create more files for you by first loading the
padstack tool, and then the part building software.

3. Once completed, you will want to move the files that have
been created to your appropriate directory structure, so that
the parts are available for use in your board.

This requires that you have Allegro installed in the normal
locations and that it can be found in your pathing.  If this
is not the case, simply edit the lines in your batch file that
refer to your Allegro tools to find them in the correct location.

You may be running a newer version of the Allegro Software than the
template file we are distributing.  In this case you will be asked
to okay the loading of the file each time the script requires a
file load.  You can update the template files found in the
\installationpath\CadInfos\Allegro\*.pcb files by simply opening
them in Allegro and then saving them again in your current version
of Allegro.  You should do this with the *.dra files as well.
